an ultra minimalistic drawing app written in python

instructions

Enter draw mode by pressing the ; button

change size of brush with the left and right brackets

change color by pressing r for red, g for green, b for blue

I am currently working on custom color picking support

holding down left alt temporarily disables drawing mode so you can pick up the brush without drawing

you can tell you've exited drawing mode if the brush guide changes from white to a darker grey color

doesn't get much simpler than that!!

PLANS:

1. custom color picking support
2. support for drawing with a touch surface
3. adding images using a menu
4. brush hardness and density
5. i'm sure i wil think of more!
